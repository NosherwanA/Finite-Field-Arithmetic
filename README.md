# Finite Field Arithmetic

This project contains VHDL implementation of modular multiplication and exponentiation circuits. These circuits can work off of variable modulus values unlike other circuits online which have a fixed modulus value at compile-time.

## Components
1. Wallace Multiplier

1. Modular Multiplier

1. Modular Exponentiator

## Future Improvements

* Decreasing the latency of the final result

* Developing a generic Modular Multiplier and Exponentiator supporting larger bit width for inputs
